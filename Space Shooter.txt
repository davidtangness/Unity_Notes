Unity Tutorial - Space Shooter

In this tutorial we will create a top-down scrolling shooter. The biggest difference between this tutorial and Roll-a-ball is that we will be using imported assets rather than primitive shapes.

SETTING UP THE PROJECT

After creating a new blank project, the first thing we want to do is import the assets we'll be using for this project (the model for our player-controlled ship, etc). We'll get these from the Unity asset store. Oddly, I had to turn off "Use direct3d" in my project settings in order to actually view the store - otherwise it displays a blank screen on Unity's built-in browser. Apparently this is a widespread problem.

In this case, the import process is very simple. On unity's asset store website (https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/13866) you find the package you want, press "Open in Unity", which opens up the same page in Unity's browser. Presumably you could also browse the store from inside Unity to skip this step. Anyways, then you hit "download" and Unity pops up a hierarchical list of every asset in the package - you choose what you want and press Start, and Unity handles the rest.

Next we save our scene... nothing interesting here.

Next we set our build target to Web Player, as we did with Roll-a-ball.

Last, we go into Edit -> Project Settings -> Player and set resolution to 600x900. Then change the Game-view layout to Web so that we get an accurate representation of what the player would see in their web browser.


SETTING UP THE PLAYER

Drag our player-ship GameObject from the Assets->Models view into the Hierarchy.

Currently the player ship only has a few components - a Transform which controls its position and orientation, a Mesh and Mesh Renderer determining its shape and lighting, and a pair of shaders determining the appearance of that shape's "skin." 

We want our ship to be collidable, so we'll attach a Rigidbody component. We don't want the ship to fall according to gravity, so we'll deselect "Use Gravity."

At this point my internet dropped, so I'll wing it from here. I'm sure I'll need to set up player controls similar to those in Roll-a-ball. 

So, I'll create a Scripts folder in Assets, and in my PlayerShip gameobject I'll add a new script component -> PlayerController.cs.

First, I want to get the ship moving under player control, meaning I need to read input from WASD similar to Roll-a-ball. Unfortunately, I can't get into the Unity API reference without itnernet access, so I can't really find any new code to write.
