Thus far I've only attemped 3D development in Unity. Although Space Shooter is played from a 2D perspective, the game is still built from 3D models. This introduces two problems for my game "Bunker": First, I don't have the skills to create a good-looking 3D model, and I don't really have the time to learn. Second, I would like Bunker to work on mobile platforms, and 3D brings a significant performance hit. So, it's about time I tried some pure 2D development.

I'll start by working through Unity's Beginner 2D tutorial. This tutorial is a bit different from Roll a Ball or Space Shooter, because it simply explains concepts rather than create an example game.

2D MODE

Unity projects can be flipped between "3D mode" and "2D mode" in the Project Settings->Editor Settings menu. When in 2D mode, the main camera will automatially be set to orthographic perspective, and textures will automatically be imported as Sprites.

Unity's "Scene View" can also be flipped between 2D and 3D mode, but this does not change the underlying game.
